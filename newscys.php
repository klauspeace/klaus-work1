				The Children and Youth Sunday which is supposed to take place on Sunday, February 10, 2019 as per the P.C.C program, was moved to Sunday, February 17, 2019 in P.C.C Molyko because of reasons beyond our control. <br>
				The day was very successful as PCC Molyko Christians were thrilled during the second service by the wonderful <strong>preaching by Bro. Michael Asafor Che, President of CYF Molyko, on the theme: HUMBLE YOURSELF AND YOU WILL BE LIFTED HIGH, drawn from Luke 14:7-11</strong><br>
